# Feature: Faculty Management

**Feature ID:** 4
**Branch pattern:** `feature/4-faculty-management`
**Status:** Ready
**Created:** 2026-09-22
**Input:** Signed-in admin users manage faculty via dialogs opened from faculty rows (add, edit, delete); new faculty are added via a dialog
**Depends on:** [Feature 1 — User Authentication](feature-1-user-auth.md)

---

## User Stories

### US-4.1: Create faculty
**As a** signed-in admin user  
**I want to** create a faculty (e.g. "David North")  
**So that** I can later assign this faculty to a section

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Open add-faculty dialog, create a faculty; it appears in the faculty view  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-4.1 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-4.2: View faculty
**As a** signed-in admin user  
**I want to** see all the faculty on one screen  
**So that** I can see what faculty have been created

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Faculty view loads a single list of faculty (no sidebar split)  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-4.2 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-4.3: Manage faculty rows
**As a** signed-in admin user  
**I want** each faculty row to show **edit** and **delete** actions  
**So that** I can manage faculty without leaving the faculty view

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Each faculty row exposes edit and delete icon actions  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-4.3 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-4.4: Update and delete faculty
**As a** signed-in admin user  
**I want to** update or delete faculty 
**So that** I can keep the faculty up-to-date

**Priority:** P1 
**Independent test:** Update and delete a faculty from row actions; faculty view updates  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-4.4 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-4.5: Admin-only faculty
**As the** application
**I want to** reject student and unauthenticated access to faculty
**So that** only admin users can read or change faculty

**Priority:** P1
**Independent test:** Student `GET /api/faculty` returns `403`; guest UI goes to login
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-4.5 under Acceptance Criteria

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All faculty endpoints MUST require a valid session (`authenticate` middleware).
- **FR-002**: All faculty endpoints MUST only be accessible by admin users.
- **FR-003**: Faculty first names MUST be trimmed before save; empty strings MUST be rejected.
- **FR-004**: Faculty last names MUST be trimmed before save; empty strings MUST be rejected.
- **FR-005**: Faculty departments MUST be trimmed before save; empty strings MUST be rejected.
- **FR-006**: Faculty first names MUST have a max length of 255; longer strings MUST be rejected.
- **FR-007**: Faculty last names MUST have a max length of 255; longer strings MUST be rejected.
- **FR-008**: Faculty departments MUST have a max length of 255; longer strings MUST be rejected.
- **FR-009**: Faculty MUST be ordered alphabetically by first name in API responses.
- **FR-010**: This feature MUST deliver faculty CRUD and a **single-view** faculty UI (dialog-based add/edit/delete). No sidebar/main split.
- **FR-011**: Faculty first name, last name, and department MUST NOT be
  required to be unique.

---

## Assumptions

- Feature 1 auth and session handling MUST be merged to `dev` before implementing this feature.
- Faculty add and edit use **dialog-based** workflows (no split sidebar / main panel).

## Edge Cases

- Empty or whitespace-only first name, last name, or department
  → UI blocks submit (no request).
- Invalid `facultyId` → `400`.
- Unauthenticated faculty view or `GET /api/faculty` → redirect or `401`.
- Faculty with identical first name, last name, and department are accepted.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: Every Gherkin scenario has at least one automated test before merge.
- **SC-002**: Signed-in admin user can create, view, update, and delete faculty on one screen.
- **SC-003**: `npm test` passes for faculty API and faculty view behavior.

## Data Ownership & Isolation

Admin users have exclusive access to faculty. An authenticated student user must not be able to view, update, or delete them.

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Read scope** | `GET /api/faculty` returns only faculty after checking that `req.user.role` is `admin`. |
| **Write scope** | `PUT` and `DELETE` apply only after checking that `req.user.role` is `admin`. |
| **Create scope** | New faculty are only created after checking that `req.user.role` is `admin`. |
| **Cross-user-role access** | If a faculty is accessed by a user with student role, respond with `403`. |
| **UI scope** | The faculty view shows only faculty returned by `GET /api/faculty` to the signed-in admin user. |
| **Implementation** | Protect all faculty routes with `authenticate` then `requireAdmin`.
  Load a faculty by primary key for `PUT`/`DELETE`. If missing, return `404`.
  Do not scope faculty by `userId`. |

---

## Key Entities

- **Faculty**: entity accessible by admin users; will be assigned to sections (Feature 5).
- **User**: edits the faculty (from Feature 1).

---

## API Requirements

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|----------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/faculty` | Yes | Fetch all faculty for the authenticated admin user |
| `POST` | `/api/faculty` | Yes | Create a new faculty |
| `PUT` | `/api/faculty/:facultyId` | Yes | Update a faculty |
| `DELETE` | `/api/faculty/:facultyId` | Yes | Delete a faculty |

All endpoints return data **only to the authenticated admin user**. Student-user-role access attempts return `403`.

**Create faculty request body:**
```json
{ 
    "firstName": "David",
    "lastName": "North",
    "department": "Computer Science"
}
```

**Update faculty request body:**
```json
{ 
    "firstName": "David",
    "lastName": "North",
    "department": "Computer Science"
}
```

**Faculty success response** (`200` / `201`):
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "David",
  "lastName": "North",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**List success response** (`200` on `GET /api/faculty`):
```json
[ {
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "David",
  "lastName": "North",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}, 
{
  "id": 2,
  "firstName": "Glen",
  "lastName": "Davis",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "createdAt": "2026-08-02T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-08-02T12:00:00.000Z"
} ]
```

**Error response:** `{ "message": "Human-readable explanation." }` with appropriate HTTP status.  
**Forbidden (student role):** `403` with `{ "message": "Not Authorized." }`
**Not found (admin, unknown id):** `404` with `{ "message": "Faculty with id=${facultyId} not found." }`

---

## Screen Requirements


### [View: Faculty] — route name `faculty`
**Single Vue view** (`Faculty.vue`) — no sidebar / main-panel split.

**Faculty view (this feature)**
*   Heading: **Faculty**
*   Primary action: **+ New Faculty** opens a `<v-dialog>` with a first-name `<v-text-field>`, last-name `<v-text-field>`, department `<v-text-field>`, and **Create** / **Cancel**. Use class `oc-cta` on **Create** and **+ New Faculty** (per [ui-style-system.mdc](../../.cursor/rules/ui-style-system.mdc)).
*   Display faculty in a table (`v-data-table` or equivalent) with columns
    **Faculty Name**, **Department**, and **Actions**.
    *   Faculty Name is `firstName` + ` ` + `lastName` (e.g. `David North`).
    *   Actions are:
        *   **Edit** icon — opens edit `<v-dialog>` pre-filled with current first name, last name, and department; **Save** (with oc-cta) / **Cancel**
        *   **Delete** icon — opens confirmation `<v-dialog>`; **"Delete faculty?"** with **Delete** (with oc-cta) / **Cancel**.
    *   Icon-only row actions use `size="small"` and accessible `aria-label`s (**Edit faculty**, **Delete faculty**).
*   **Empty state:** **"No faculty yet. Create the first faculty."** when there exist zero faculty.
*   **Loading state:** skeleton or progress indicator while faculty are fetching.
*   **Error state:** `<v-alert type="error">` for API failures.

**App chrome**
*   `MenuBar` shows a **Faculty** nav link only when signed in as admin.
*   Guests attempting to navigate to `/faculty` by URL are redirected to a login screen.
*   Authenticated students who open `/faculty` by URL are redirected to home and do not see the Faculty heading or any faculty rows.
*   The Faculty nav link is hidden for students.
*   The Faculty nav link is hidden for guest users.
*   `MenuBar` is shown app-wide via `App.vue`.

**Implementation note:** one route/view for faculty; faculty CRUD dialogs are child components or inline `<v-dialog>` blocks in `Faculty.vue` unless the team splits presentational dialogs later.

## Data Model Requirements
