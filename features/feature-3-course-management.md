## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All course endpoints MUST require a valid session (`authenticate` middleware).
- **FR-002**: All course fields MUST be trimmed before save; empty strings MUST be rejected.
- **FR-003**: Courses MUST be ordered alphabetically by courseNumber in API responses.
- **FR-004**: This feature MUST deliver course CRUD and a **single-view** courses UI in `Courses.vue` (dialog-based add/edit/delete). No sidebar/main split.
- **FR-005**: `courseNumber` MUST be in the format of XXXX-#### (ex. COMP-2100)
- **FR-006**: `courseName` MUST be no longer than 255 characters
- **FR-007**: `courseFrequency` MUST be one of `Yearly`, `Odd Years`, `Even Years`
- **FR-008**: `courseSemester` MUST be one or more of ["Fall", "Winter", "Spring", "Summer"]
- **FR-009**: `courseHours` MUST be a multiple of `0.5`

---

## Assumptions

- Courses use **dialog-based** workflows (no split sidebar / main panel).

## Edge Cases

- Empty or whitespace-only course name → client block and/or `400`.
- Course name longer than 255 characters → `400`.
- Unauthenticated courses screen or `GET /courses` → redirect or `401`.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: Every Gherkin scenario has at least one automated test before merge.
- **SC-002**: Signed-in admin can create, view, edit, and delete courses on one screen.
- **SC-003**: `npm test` passes for courses API and courses view behavior.

---

## Data Ownership & Isolation

Only signed-in admin users should be able to manage courses. Other signed-in users may browse courses.

---

## API Requirements

| Method   | Endpoint             | Auth        | Purpose             |
| -------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/courses`           | Yes         | Fetch all courses   |
| `GET`    | `/courses/:courseId` | Yes         | Fetch a single      |
| `POST`   | `/courses`           | Yes - Admin | Create a new course |
| `PUT`    | `/courses/:courseId` | Yes - Admin | Edit a course       |
| `DELETE` | `/courses/:courseId` | Yes - Admin | Delete course       |

**Create course request body:**

```json
{
  "courseNumber": "COMP-2100",
  "courseName": "Programming II",
  "courseDescription": "Magna tempor ipsum reprehenderit nostrud laboris eu non Lorem. Ipsum est pariatur ut officia excepteur non laboris.",
  "courseSemester": "Fall",
  "courseFrequency": "Yearly",
  "courseHours": 3,
  "courseDept": "Computer Science"
}
```

**Course success response** (`200` / `201`):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "courseNumber": "COMP-2100",
  "courseName": "Programming II",
  "courseDescription": "Magna tempor ipsum reprehenderit nostrud laboris eu non Lorem. Ipsum est pariatur ut officia excepteur non laboris.",
  "courseSemester": "Fall",
  "courseFrequency": "Yearly",
  "courseHours": 3,
  "courseDept": "Computer Science",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Error response:** `{ "message": "Human-readable explanation." }` with appropriate HTTP status.  
**Not found:** `404` (do not use `403`).

---

## Screen Requirements

### [View: Courses] — route name `courses`

**Single Vue view** (`Courses.vue`) — no sidebar / main-panel split.

**Courses view (this feature)**

- Heading: **Courses**
- Primary action: **+ New Course** opens a `<v-dialog>` with a name `<v-text-field>` and **Create** / **Cancel**. Use class `oc-cta` on **Create** and **+ New List** (per [ui-style-system.mdc](../../.cursor/rules/ui-style-system.mdc)).
- Secondary action: **Search** input field
- Display courses as rows (e.g. `<v-list>` or table): each row shows the **course name**, **course number**, **semester**, **frequency**, **hours**, **department** and icon actions:
  - **Edit** icon — opens rename `<v-dialog>` pre-filled with current data; **Save** / **Cancel**
  - **Delete** icon — opens confirmation `<v-dialog>`
- Icon-only row actions use `size="small"` and accessible `aria-label`s (**Edit course**, **Delete course**).
- **Empty state:** **"No courses yet. Create your first course."** when there are no courses.
- **Loading state:** skeleton or progress indicator while courses are fetching.
- **Error state:** `<v-alert type="error">` for API failures.
- **Pagination:** courses are paginated when there are more than 20 rows

**Implementation note:** one route/view for courses; courses CRUD dialogs are child components or inline `<v-dialog>` blocks in `Courses.vue`.

---

## Key Entities

- **Course**: one course the university offers, distinct from sections of the course

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)

### US-3.1 — Create courses

#### Scenario: Admin creates course

- **Given** I am signed in as an admin

#### Scenario: User creates course with missing fields

- **Given** I am signed in as an admin
- **When** I open the new course dialog and I leave the `courseName` field empty and submit
- **Then** inline validation blocks the request I see a required field validation message

#### Scenario: User creates a course with invalid fields

- **Given** I am signed in as an admin
- **When** I enter a course number formatted as `CS210` instead of `XXXX-####`
- **Then** the API returns `400` with an invalid format message and an error is displayed
